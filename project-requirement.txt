**Optimized Prompt:**

- **Create a Python Flask Application:**
  - Set up a new Flask project using a virtual environment.
  - Install necessary libraries including Flask, Keras, and keras-ocr.

- **Initialize the Keras-OCR Model:**
  - Import the keras-ocr library and initialize the model.
  - Ensure that all required dependencies are installed.

- **Create APIs for Model Access:**
  - Develop two RESTful API endpoints:
    1. **Pre-trained Model API:**
       - Endpoint: `/api/pretrained`
       - Method: POST
       - Input: Image data (base64 encoded or file upload)
       - Output: Detected text in JSON format.
    2. **Self-trained Model API:**
       - Endpoint: `/api/selftrained`
       - Method: POST
       - Input: Image data (base64 encoded or file upload)
       - Output: Detected text in JSON format.

- **Develop User Interface (UI):**
  - Create a simple web interface using HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
  - Implement a file upload feature for image inputs.
  - Display results from the API in a user-friendly format.

- **Testing and Validation:**
  - Ensure that both APIs return accurate results with appropriate error handling.
  - Test the UI for usability and responsiveness.

- **Documentation:**
  - Write clear documentation for setting up and using the application, including API usage examples.

Each of these steps should be implemented with a focus on clarity and practicality, ensuring that the application is user-friendly and effective in its function.
